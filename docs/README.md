# What is Isle Finance?

**Isle Finance** is the decentralized protocol for globally accessible supply chain finance, with a mission to bring the world's supply chain activity on-chain while _expanding capital access_ and _increasing supply chain resilience_.

## Financing the global supply chain with DeFi

If the supply chain is the basis of the global economy, then supply chain finance is the _lifeblood_ of the global economy. Supply chain finance is the very tool that can help businesses improve their cash flow and reduce costs. Despite its obvious benefits, [its potential continues to be limited for the following reasons](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/accelerating%20winds%20of%20change%20in%20global%20payments/chapter-3-supply-chain-finance-a-case-of-convergent-evolution.pdf):

- High Fragmentation
  - e.g. process flows, data sharing, multiple parties, asset types
- Geopolitical turmoil
- Inefficient paper-based procedure
- Limited credit and expertise

The aforementioned issues are particularly severe for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since they lack the necessary scale to overcome the associated friction and time-consuming processes. Consequently, we believe that decentralized finance (DeFi) technology represents the most effective approach for resolving these challenges.

- **Highly Integrated Tech Stack**: The DeFi technology stack is intentionally designed to be highly interconnected and compatible. It is not uncommon to observe various protocols depending on one another as building blocks for a more comprehensive whole. This approach enables the decentralized nature of the process to be retained while minimizing friction. As a result, DeFi technology is an excellent means of achieving this objective.
- **Global by Default**: DeFi is, by default, a global technology, making it an ideal solution for serving the supply chain in the age of globalization and navigating the geopolitical turmoil and varying regulatory landscape.
- **Digital-native Technology**: Despite considerable efforts over the past two decades, digital adoption in supply chain management has been lagging due to the lack of proper digital infrastructure. DeFi is able to serve as a trusted and reliable digital alternative that has the potential to replace most, if not all, of the inefficient paper-based procedures.
- **Transparent and Trustless**: We believe that _credit_ is going to become more easily verifiable using decentralized technology with the help of increasing DeFi adoption and better oracles. Moreover, as zero-knowledge technology matures, on-chain activities could be both trustless and privacy-enabled. The [Proof of Income landscape](https://blog.spectral.finance/the-state-of-on-chain-proof-of-income/) is especially getting a lot of attention, signaling the ecosystem's optimism in this space.

Therefore, Isle Finance is here to **bring all real-world supply chain economic activity on chain and foster global economic prosperity with DeFi technology.**

## Providing real-world investment opportunities for DeFi

Besides the benefits of using DeFi technology for the supply chain, **Isle Finance** is also able to contribute immense value to the entire crypto ecosystem.

The protocol makes crypto loans without requiring crypto collateral. Instead, it relies on real-world supply chain activity, which finally unlocks access to crypto capital for companies around the world. By collaborating and integrating with the vibrant crypto ecosystem (digital identity solutions, decentralized credit oracles, etc.), **Isle** is the solution for crypto capital to finance the global supply chain.

Over the past decade, the crypto space has been notorious for speculative activities, rug pulls, hacks, and more. It has been associated with high risks due to the prevalence of information asymmetry created in complex crypto-money games. We believe that without real-world economic activities, the need for complex financial derivatives will be limited, and adoption will only go so far. **Isle** is here to be the foundational building block to bring the supply chain onto DeFi. By doing so, **Isle** can significantly expand the use case of DeFi.
