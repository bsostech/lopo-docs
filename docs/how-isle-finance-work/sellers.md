## Supplier Onboarding

In order to become a valid supplier for reverse factoring, the supplier will have to send an application to the corresponding **Pool Admin** to get whitelisted. Note that a seller must be whitelisted before they can redeem funds.

After invoices are approved for their suppliers, the suppliers will be able to withdraw the principal of the loans at any time by transferring the receivables NFT to the `LoanManager`.
